					<h2>Do I need to register and why?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>You don’t have to register if you’re just browsing our website, but if you want to shop with us you will need to register.

				<div class="question">
					<h2>How do I find products?</h2>
				</div>	
				<div class="answer">
					<p>There are many ways to find the products that you want to buy:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Browse the aisles by clicking on the category list e.g. baby, grocery. You can then filter down to a smaller category using the filters at the top of the page.</p></li>
						<li><p>Search for products using the search box (the list will be alphabetically sorted).</p></li>
						<li><p>Use the Promotions list. This shows a list of products that are on promotion. You can filter this to a shorter list using the departments at the top of the page.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>	
				
				<br>
				
				<div class="question">
					<h2>Do you charge different prices online to the prices in store?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The prices you will pay online are the same as in the store on the day you checkout. This includes promotions. 
						The prices that are displayed on the website are the same prices you will see in our stores. 
						This excludes the Exclusive Online Only price, promotion, and product range whereby these are only available on the online shop.</p>
				</div>	

				
				<br>
				
				<div class="question">
					<h2>How can I pay for my shopping?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>You can pay at the door by card or Touch ‘n Go e-wallet. In this case you will not be charged for your shopping until after it has been delivered to you.
						You can also pay online by card. In this case, a holding amount is made after picking but the payment will only be done after your shopping has been delivered to you. 
						Unfortunately we will not accept the cash as payment for your shopping. This is because our Customer Delivery Assistants cannot carry cash with them due to safety reasons.</p>
