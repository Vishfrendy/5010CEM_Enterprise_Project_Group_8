							<p>As a leading grocery store in Malaysia, with more than 10,000 colleagues, we aim to serve customers every day with affordable, 
								healthy and sustainable food to help them enjoy a better quality of life and an easier way of living.</p>
							<p><b>Our service is delivering Filipino products and food essentials to residents across Canada and United States.</b></p>
							<p>Grocery Delivery was born out of necessity because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our core business, Party Rentals, 
								is on hold for now as large gatherings such as parties and conferences are all cancelled. So we saw an opportunity to use our delivery van to help out the community, 
								who, like us, are under lockdown and may find it difficult to get out to the grocery store and brave long lines in order to obtain food to eat and other essentials. 
								This is particularly a challenge for our seniors and those of you with small children. Grocery delivers your orders right to your door with no contact with our delivery driver. 
								We embody a strict safety policy ensuring we are always wearing face masks and gloves when delivering groceries, while constantly sanitizing our vehicle.</p>
